                Coding is going to help my family life. My husband is the main provider
                in our family and works a commission only position. My current job does
                I do not bring in enough income to provide for the family other then daycare
                costs. By learning to code and obtaining a position in a development role
                will allow me to provide for my family and support my husband so he does not
                have to stress so much over money. Also it will allow me to provide for my son
                and my baby I am currently pregnant with.

                Learning to code and starting a new job where I will be bringing in substantially
                more income will allow for my qulaity of life to improve because I will be able 
                to enjoy life more and participate in more fun activities with my family. I will
                be able to bring my kids out on fun adventures and take more time with my family
                on vacations and doing fun events together. We won't have to worry about household
                bills as much and be able to have some savings set aside in case of emergency.

                    My degree is in Resort and Hospitality management and had much more
                    pride in myself when I was in a higher paying position as a hotel manager
                    prior to having my son and becoming a single mom. Now I am working for much less
                    income and I know I am capable of so much more. I have always enjoyed math and science
                    and have loved computers, my father is a developer for SalesForce.com so I grew
                    up around him and seeing him enjoy his job and the benefits of his line of work
                    have attracted me to learn coding so I can better myself. I am so excited for this
                    opportunity to better myself and apply the knowledge to a skill I feel I am capable
                    of learning and doing.
